//! `orangu-server suggest`: a rough, hardware-based suggestion for which
//! GGUF model *size* (parameter count) is likely to run comfortably on this
//! machine — not a specific model yet, just a size class. Reuses the same
//! CPU/GPU detection `system` reports, then estimates the total VRAM a
//! candidate model would need across a curated ladder of common open-weight
//! parameter counts, recommending the largest that fits — for each of
//! several context lengths ([`CONTEXT_LADDER`], 1K to 256K) and each of a
//! few common quantizations ([`QUANT_LADDER`]: `Q2_K`, `Q4_K_M` — this
//! project's own default, matching `orangu::model_download`'s
//! `DEFAULT_TAG_PREFERENCE` — and `Q8_0`), presented as a table.
//!
//! The memory-estimation formula mirrors Sam McLeod's GGUF VRAM Estimator
//! (<https://smcleod.net/vram-estimator/>, read directly from its published
//! `vram-calculator.min.js` rather than guessed) and the general shape of
//! erans/selfhostllm's calculator (<https://github.com/erans/selfhostllm>):
//! model weight bytes scale as parameters × bits-per-weight ÷ 8, KV cache
//! bytes scale with context length × layers × hidden size, plus a small
//! fixed runtime overhead. Since there's no real GGUF file to read yet
//! (`suggest` runs before any model is chosen), hidden size and layer count
//! are themselves estimated from the parameter count via the standard
//! transformer parameter-count approximation (params ≈ 12 × layers ×
//! hidden_size²) — the same fallback smcleod's own calculator uses when it
//! has no real GGUF metadata to read.
