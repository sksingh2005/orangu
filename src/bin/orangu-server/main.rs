//! `orangu-server <model>`: loads a GGUF model and serves a llama.cpp-
//! compatible HTTP API. Also the machine's one-stop GGUF inventory tool —
//! `system`/`suggest`/`list`/`show`/`download`/`delete`/`refresh` answer the
//! questions that matter when *getting*, *choosing*, and *keeping current* a
//! model to run, before any serving starts (formerly the separate
//! `orangu-gguf` binary, folded in here so
//! there's one tool, one config file, and one shell-completion script to
//! keep in sync with the models directory convention both jobs share).

// The `Send`/`Sync` proof for the web UI's SSE stream walks the whole wgpu
// type graph the Vulkan backend pulls in, which sits right at the default
// 128-step auto-trait recursion limit — deep enough that adding a single
// field to `web::WebState` overflows it (in the test build only, where the
// stream type is monomorphized again). Raising it is rustc's own suggested
// remedy and costs nothing but a deeper proof search.
