//! WGSL compute shaders — one per supported `ggml_type` — that dequantize a
//! weight matrix's raw, still-quantized bytes and dot-product it against the
//! input activations directly on the GPU. Each type's dequantization math
//! (`dequant_element`, in each `*_COOP_MIDDLE` constant) is a line-for-line
//! port of its `engine::quant::dequantize_*` Rust counterpart (which itself
//! mirrors ggml's `dequantize_row_*` exactly) — read them side by side when
//! changing either.
//!
//! Two dispatch strategies share those same per-type `dequant_element`
//! functions (see each `*_COOP_MIDDLE`'s doc comment for why a *third*,
//! now-removed strategy — one thread computing a whole `(row, token)`
//! sequentially — was replaced):
//!
//! - **`MAIN_REDUCE_SUFFIX`** (small `n_tokens`, e.g. decode's `n_tokens ==
//!   1`, `VulkanBackend::COOP_MIN_N_TOKENS`): one workgroup per `(row,
//!   token)` pair, all 64 threads splitting that *row's own elements*
//!   (`k`, `k+64`, `k+128`, ...) and reducing their partial dot-product
//!   sums together. Replaced an earlier one-thread-per-row design once
//!   real measurements against `unsloth/gemma-4-E2B`'s actual shapes (its
//!   262144-entry vocabulary in particular — a single lm_head call cost
//!   ~138ms) showed that design's memory access pattern was badly
//!   uncoalesced: adjacent threads in the same wavefront, each owning a
//!   *different row*, read memory `row_bytes` (hundreds of bytes) apart at
//!   every step, instead of the current design's adjacent threads reading
//!   *adjacent elements of the same row*.
//! - **`MAIN_COOP_SUFFIX`** (large `n_tokens`, e.g. a long prompt's
//!   prefill): one workgroup per output row, looping over *all* tokens —
//!   dequantizes each block once into shared memory and reuses it across
//!   up to 64 tokens' worth of threads, avoiding the redundant
//!   re-dequantizing `MAIN_REDUCE_SUFFIX` would otherwise do once per
//!   `(row, token)` pair when many tokens genuinely share the same row.
//!
//! `PRELUDE` (buffer bindings + byte/half-float decode helpers) is shared
//! by both, concatenated with a type's `*_COOP_MIDDLE` and the relevant
//! `MAIN_*_SUFFIX` once at `VulkanBackend` construction time into 18
//! complete, self-contained WGSL modules (9 types × 2 dispatch strategies).
