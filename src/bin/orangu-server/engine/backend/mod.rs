//! The seam a GPU backend plugs into without touching the model code in
//! `engine::arch`: everything the forward pass needs from "the thing that
//! actually multiplies matrices" is this one trait.
//!
//! Implementors: `CpuBackend` (scalar with runtime AVX2 dispatch, always
//! available); `VulkanBackend` (compute shaders via `wgpu`, the most
//! mature GPU backend — real fused attention/RoPE/layer submissions,
//! verified against real AMD hardware, see its own module doc); `cuda`'s
//! `CudaBackend` and `opencl`'s `OpenClBackend` (both dlopen their vendor
//! library at runtime, same as `wgpu`, so both are always compiled in);
//! `rocm`'s `RocmBackend` (behind the `rocm` Cargo feature, off by
//! default — the one exception, since `cubecl-hip-sys` hard-links a vendor
//! library at *build* time, see that module's own doc comment for why).
//! `CudaBackend`/`OpenClBackend`/`RocmBackend` are each a real but
//! smaller-scoped `matmul`-only implementation — see their module docs for
//! exactly what's ported and what isn't.
//!
//! Earlier revisions of this file claimed AMD GPUs are reached only through
//! `VulkanBackend` (Mesa/RADV implements Vulkan on AMD hardware directly)
//! and that there was no separate ROCm/HIP backend. That's still true for
//! Vulkan/RADV as a *path* to AMD hardware — it's real, verified, and the
//! default `auto` backend selection still prefers it — but `rocm::
//! RocmBackend` now also exists as a genuine, separate HIP-based backend
//! for when it's specifically asked for (`backend = rocm`).
