//! Cross-sequence GEMM batching coordinator. `engine::generate::run`
//! (one blocking-pool thread per concurrently-generating request) submits
//! each decode step here instead of calling `ModelForward::forward_maybe_
//! sampling` directly; this collects together whichever requests submit
//! their next decode step within a short window, and processes them as one
//! `ModelForward::forward_batch_decode` call — the matmul steps fused
//! across every sequence in the batch, attention/RoPE/the KV-cache write
//! still per-sequence (see that trait method's own doc comment).
//!
//! **Only used when a caller opts in** (`ORANGU_BATCH_DECODE=1`,
//! `main.rs`) — this coordinator's own concurrency correctness is solid
//! (see this module's own tests, plus a real multi-request run against the
//! actual model where every request got back its own, correctly-attributed
//! answer), but the batched forward pass it drives measured *slower* under
//! real concurrent load than not batching at all — `engine::generate::
//! Engine::batch_coordinator`'s own doc comment has the numbers and the
//! likely cause. This module is exercised, verified, and left in place for
//! future work, not deleted.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A `Mutex<CoordState>` + `Condvar`, not an async channel: `run` calls
//! this from a blocking-pool thread (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`), so a
//! plain `std::sync` rendezvous is the natural fit — no runtime handle
//! juggling needed to `.await` anything here.
//!
//! Each submitting thread pushes its own `(request, response sender)` into
//! `pending`, then loops: if the batch has reached its target size (`SlotPool::
//! busy_count`) or this collection window's deadline has passed, *this*
//! thread becomes the batch's leader
//! — drains `pending`, processes the whole batch (dropping the lock first,
//! since this can take real time), and wakes every other waiter so they
//! can re-check. Otherwise it waits on the condvar (bounded by `POLL_
//! INTERVAL`, so it always re-checks the deadline even if no notification
//! ever arrives) and loops. Every request either becomes a leader itself
//! or gets swept up by one within `MAX_BATCH_WAIT` of when it first
//! arrived — no participant can wait past that bound, and no batch can
//! grow forever waiting for stragglers, since the deadline is fixed the
//! moment the *first* request in a fresh window arrives, never extended by
//! later arrivals.
