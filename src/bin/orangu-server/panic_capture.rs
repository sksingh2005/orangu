//! Stashes a panic's own message/location/backtrace where `engine::
//! generate::Engine::generate`'s `catch_unwind` (around a request's
//! `spawn_blocking` closure) can retrieve it on the *same* thread right
//! after catching the unwind — the only way to recover this detail at all,
//! since `tokio::task::JoinError`'s own `Display` for a panic is just an
//! opaque "task panicked" note, never the payload or a backtrace. Without
//! this, a panicking request degraded to that one-line note both in the
//! server's own log and (via `StreamEvent::Error`) the client — the web
//! UI's "download a debug report" feature (`web::mod::system_report`,
//! `app.js`'s Save button on an error bubble) needs the real detail to be
//! worth anything.
//!
//! A thread-local, not a global `Mutex`/channel: `std::panic::set_hook`'s
//! closure runs synchronously, on the panicking thread itself, before
//! unwinding starts — by the time `catch_unwind` on that *same* thread
//! returns, the stash is already populated and nothing else could have
//! raced to overwrite it (each `spawn_blocking` closure runs to completion
//! on whichever blocking-pool thread picked it up before that thread is
//! handed another task).
