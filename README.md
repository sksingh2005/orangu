# orangu

**orangu** is a coding environment for **OpenAI-compatible** servers.

**orangu** is named after the [Orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan) - the smartest ape.

## Features

- Coding environment (LLM based)
- Command history
- Completion of commands

## Configuration

`orangu` reads an INI-style configuration

Default lookup order:

1. `./orangu.conf`
2. `~/.orangu/orangu.conf`

Or use `--config` to point to a configuration file.

## Running

```sh
orangu
```

By default, local tools operate on the **current working directory**. Use `--workspace` to point at another root.

Use `/open_file README.md` to launch a workspace file in the editor configured by `$EDITOR`. Natural-language equivalents such as `open README.md`, `list models`, and `show help` are also handled locally.
