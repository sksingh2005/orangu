# Terminal interface

`orangu` is an interactive terminal client with a persistent header and a prompt area anchored to the bottom of the terminal.

## Header

The top banner displays:

- Current version
- Workspace status
- Server status
- Model status
- `/help` reminder

While no request is active, server and model status are rechecked once per minute.

## Prompt area

The prompt area stays at the bottom of the terminal window.

- Long input wraps upward
- Submitted input moves directly into the output area
- The banner and prompt stay fixed while the output window scrolls independently
- Markdown in assistant output is rendered with terminal styling when possible, including emphasis, strong text, lists, headings, links, and code
- Fenced code blocks with a language tag such as ```c use syntax highlighting in the terminal when the language is supported by the bundled highlighter

## Waiting state

While the model is generating a response, the left side of the footer shows a rolling:

```text
Thinking (2s)
```

status indicator.

You can keep typing and submitting commands while a response is pending. Submitted commands are queued and executed in order after the active response finishes.

When a profile uses `provider = llama.cpp`, the footer starts with `Thinking (<CLOCK>)` and switches to llama.cpp's native generation throughput once tokens are streaming, for example `Working @ 42.5 t/s (2s)`.

Press `Esc` twice within 2 seconds during the waiting state to cancel the active request without exiting the client. Queued commands are preserved.

## History and navigation

Command history is stored in:

```text
~/.orangu/orangu.history
```

Use:

- `<ARROW_UP>` to move backward in history
- `<ARROW_DOWN>` to move forward in history

## Local commands

All slash commands are handled locally. They are not sent to the model.

| Command | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/connect [url]` | Connect to the configured server, or a specific server |
| `/disconnect` | Disconnect from the current server |
| `/reload` | Restore the configured model and server |
| `/list_models` | List models |
| `/list_files` | List workspace files as a tree |
| `/show_file [--hash] [--author] <path>` | Show a file with optional Git metadata |
| `/tools` | List tools |
| `/model [name]` | Switch to the configured model, or a specific model |
| `/diff` | Show a color unified diff against the current branch |
| `/status` | Show working tree status with color highlighting |
| `/log` | Show commit log (uses `git lg` alias if configured) |
| `/pull <number>` | Check out a GitHub pull request on a dedicated branch |
| `/rebase` | Rebase the current branch against master/main |
| `/merge <branch>` | Merge a branch into the current branch |
| `/checkout <branch\|file>` | Switch branch or restore a file |
| `/add_file <path>` | Stage a file or directory with git add |
| `/remove_file <path>` | Remove a file or directory from Git tracking |
| `/move_file <source> <destination>` | Rename or move a tracked file with git mv |
| `/cherry_pick <commit>` | Cherry-pick a commit onto the current branch |
| `/commit <message>` | Commit all tracked changes with git commit -a -m |
| `/push [--force]` | Push the current branch to origin |
| `/init_repo` | Initialize a Git repository in the workspace |
| `/squash` | Squash all branch commits into one using the first commit message |
| `/delete <branch>` | Delete a local branch |
| `/open_file <path>` | Open a workspace file in $EDITOR |
| `/clear` | Clear the current conversation |
| `/quit` | Exit the client |

Local commands continue to work even when the model is unavailable.

Free-form prompts are blocked when the server or model status in the header is red.

## Command notes

- `/tools` lists the model-facing workspace tools described in the tools chapter
- `/open_file <path>` is workspace-scoped; paths outside the workspace are rejected
- `/show_file [--hash] [--author] <path>` is workspace-scoped; when `bat` is installed it is used for the plain file view, otherwise the built-in syntax-highlighted renderer is used, and Git blame hash/author columns still use the built-in renderer
- `/diff` uses `git diff` inside Git repositories and applies configured non-interactive Git pagers such as `delta`; outside Git repositories it keeps the existing non-Git behavior
- `/status` requires a Git repository and runs `git status --branch --short`; `gh` has no equivalent so it always uses plain Git; added files and untracked entries are shown in green, deleted entries in red, and modified entries in the default terminal color; the branch line is shown in a muted color
- `/log` requires a Git repository; if a `lg` alias is found in `~/.gitconfig` it runs `git lg`, otherwise it falls back to `git log --graph --oneline --decorate`; see the optional tools chapter for the recommended `git lg` alias setup
- `/pull <number>` requires a Git repository; if `gh` is installed it uses `gh pr checkout`, otherwise it fetches the pull request directly from `origin`
- `/rebase` requires a Git repository; if `gh` is installed it queries the repository default branch, otherwise it probes `origin/main` then `origin/master`
- `/merge <branch>` requires a Git repository; if `gh` is installed it uses `gh pr merge --merge`, otherwise it uses `git merge`
- `/checkout <branch|file>` requires a Git repository and runs `git checkout`; Tab completion offers branch names first, then workspace file paths
- `/add_file <path>` requires a Git repository and runs `git add`; Tab completion offers untracked directories first, then untracked files
- `/remove_file <path>` requires a Git repository and runs `git rm` (with `-r` for directories); Tab completion offers tracked directories first, then tracked files
- `/move_file <source> <destination>` requires a Git repository and runs `git mv`; Tab completion for the first argument offers tracked directories first, then tracked files; Tab completion for the second argument offers workspace paths
- `/cherry_pick <commit>` requires a Git repository and runs `git cherry-pick`; `gh` has no equivalent so it always uses plain Git; Tab completion offers abbreviated commit hashes from the default branch (`origin/main`, `origin/master`, `main`, or `master`)
- `/commit <message>` requires a Git repository and runs `git commit -a -m <message>`; `gh` has no equivalent so it always uses plain Git; the message may be bare (`/commit Fix the bug`) or quoted (`/commit "[#42] My feature"`)
- `/push [--force]` requires a Git repository and runs `git push origin <branch>` using the current branch name; `gh` has no equivalent so it always uses plain Git; `--force` (or `-f` or `force`) runs `git push -f origin <branch>` but is blocked on `main` and `master` to prevent accidental history rewrites
- `/init_repo` runs `git init` in the workspace directory; works both inside and outside an existing Git repository (reinitializing an existing repo is safe); `gh` has no equivalent so it always uses plain Git
- `/squash` requires a Git repository; squashes all commits on the current branch (relative to `origin/main`, `origin/master`, `main`, or `master`, tried in that order) into a single commit using the oldest commit's message; `gh` has no equivalent so it always uses plain Git; squashing on `main` or `master` is blocked; requires at least two commits on the branch
- `/delete <branch>` requires a Git repository and runs `git branch -D`; `gh` has no equivalent so it always uses plain Git; deleting `main` or `master` is blocked; Tab completion offers local branch names excluding `main` and `master`
- `/list_files` is a local convenience command and is separate from the model-facing `list_directory` tool
- `/reload` also clears the current conversation history in memory
- `/quit` exits immediately, while `Ctrl+C` uses a two-step confirmation
- Unknown slash commands are handled locally and produce an error message that points back to `/help`

## Natural-language command aliases

Local commands can also be entered in plain language. Examples:

- `open README.md`
- `show README.md`
- `list models`
- `list files`
- `show tools`
- `show help`
- `switch model to <name>`
- `pull 58` or `pull request 58` or `pull #58`
- `log` or `show log` or `git log` or `git lg`
- `status` or `show status` or `git status`
- `rebase` or `git rebase`
- `merge feature/foo` or `git merge feature/foo`
- `checkout main` or `checkout README.md` or `git checkout main`
- `switch to main` or `switch to feature/foo` or `switch to main branch`
- `add README.md` or `add file src/` or `git add README.md`
- `remove README.md` or `remove file src/` or `git rm README.md`
- `move old.rs new.rs` or `move file old.rs new.rs` or `git mv old.rs new.rs`
- `cherry pick abc1234` or `cherry-pick abc1234` or `git cherry-pick abc1234`
- `commit "[#42] My feature"` or `commit Fix the bug` or `git commit -m "Fix the bug"`
- `push` or `git push` or `git push origin`
- `force push` or `push force` or `push --force`
- `init` or `init repo` or `git init`
- `delete feature/foo` or `delete branch feature/foo` or `git branch -D feature/foo`

Natural-language forms are recognized only for the built-in local command phrases. Ordinary prompts continue to go to the model.

## Comments and ignored input

- If the first non-whitespace character is `#`, the line is treated as a local comment, shown in the transcript, and not sent to the LLM
- If the first non-whitespace character is `\`, the line is ignored

## Shortcuts and keys

### Prompt editing

- `Ctrl+A` or `Home` moves the cursor to the start of the input line
- `Ctrl+E` or `End` moves the cursor to the end of the input line
- `Left` moves the cursor one character left
- `Right` moves the cursor one character right
- `Ctrl+Left` moves one word left using bash-style word boundaries
- `Ctrl+Right` moves one word right using bash-style word boundaries
- `Backspace` deletes the character to the left of the cursor
- `Delete` deletes the character under the cursor
- `Ctrl+D` behaves like `Delete`; when the input is empty it exits the client immediately
- `Ctrl+K` deletes from the cursor to the end of the line
- `Ctrl+U` deletes from the start of the line to the cursor
- `Ctrl+W` deletes from the cursor to the previous whitespace
- `Alt+Backspace` deletes backward using bash-style word boundaries
- `Alt+D` deletes forward using bash-style word boundaries
- Pasted text is inserted at the current cursor position

### History and completion

- `<ARROW_UP>` moves backward through command history
- `<ARROW_DOWN>` moves forward through command history
- History navigation preserves the current unfinished line as a draft and restores it when you move back out of history

### Tab completion

`Tab` uses context-sensitive completion. The first `Tab` inserts the first match. Repeated `Tab` presses cycle through the remaining matches for the same completion range.

Completion cycling is reset as soon as you edit the line, move the cursor, paste text, or otherwise change the input.

The completion modes are checked in order:

1. If the line starts with `/checkout `, or with the natural-language prefixes `checkout ` or `git checkout `, complete branch names first (from `git branch --all`), then workspace file paths. Branch names always appear before file names in the candidate list. If the line starts with the natural-language prefix `switch to `, complete branch names and tag names (from `git tag`), sorted together; workspace file paths are excluded.
2. If the line starts with `/add_file `, or with the natural-language prefixes `add `, `add file `, or `git add `, complete untracked directories first (from `git ls-files --others --directory`), then untracked files. Already-tracked content is excluded.
3. If the line starts with `/remove_file `, or with the natural-language prefixes `remove `, `remove file `, or `git rm `, complete tracked directories first (from `git ls-files`), then tracked files. Untracked content is excluded.
4. If the line starts with `/move_file `, or with the natural-language prefixes `move `, `move file `, or `git mv `, complete the first argument from tracked directories and files; complete the second argument from all workspace paths.
5. If the line starts with `/cherry_pick `, or with the natural-language prefixes `cherry pick `, `cherry-pick `, or `git cherry-pick `, complete abbreviated commit hashes from the default branch (`origin/main`, `origin/master`, `main`, or `master`, tried in that order).
6. If the line starts with `/merge `, or with the natural-language prefixes `merge ` or `git merge `, complete branch names from `git branch --all`.
7. If the line starts with `/delete `, or with the natural-language prefixes `delete `, `delete branch `, or `git branch -D `, complete local branch names (from `git branch`) excluding `main` and `master`.
8. If the line starts with `/model `, complete configured model profile names.
9. If the line starts with `/open_file ` or `/show_file `, complete workspace file paths recursively. `/show_file` also completes `--hash` and `--author`.
10. If the line starts with the natural-language prefixes `open `, `open file `, `edit `, or `edit file `, complete workspace file paths recursively.
11. If the line starts with `/`, complete built-in slash commands such as `/help`, `/list_models`, `/list_files`, `/show_file`, `/tools`, and `/quit`.
12. Otherwise, complete filesystem entries from the current token relative to the workspace, using the token before the cursor.

Path-completion details:

- General filesystem completion lists entries from the matching directory level and appends `/` to directories
- `/open_file`, `/show_file`, and the natural-language open/edit forms search recursively through the workspace
- Recursive file completion matches either the full relative path or, when no `/` is present in the token, the file name
- Quoted file completion is supported for `/open_file "..."`, `/show_file "..."`, and `open "..."`; the inserted completion keeps the opening quote
- Completion skips `.git`, `build`, and `target` content
- Completion also skips paths ignored by the workspace `.gitignore`

### Output scrolling

- `Shift+PageUp` scrolls backward through the output window
- `Shift+PageDown` scrolls forward through the output window
- The output scrollback buffer keeps the most recent 10,000 lines
- Scrolling is limited to the output window; it does not replace the header or prompt area

### Waiting and exit control

- `Esc` twice within 2 seconds cancels the active request without exiting and keeps queued commands
- `Ctrl+C` once arms quit mode, shows a warning in the transcript, and clears the current input line
- `Ctrl+C` again within 2 seconds exits the client
- `Enter` submits the current input line

## Footer behavior

- The left side of the footer shows `Thinking (<CLOCK>)` while waiting for a response to start, and `Working @ X.Y t/s (<CLOCK>)` while tokens are streaming
- The center side of the footer shows `Pending: X` to show how many queued commands are waiting
- The right side of the footer shows the model name used
