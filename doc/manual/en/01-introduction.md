# Introduction

[**orangu**][orangu] is a local, workspace-aware, tool-driven coding environment.

More than a client, **orangu is a complete, self-contained AI coding stack** — three
cooperating programs written end to end in Rust: the coding environment
(`orangu`), an on-demand model manager (`orangu-coordinator`, see the *Coordinator*
chapter), and a native, pure-Rust GGUF inference server (`orangu-server`, see the
*Inference server* chapter) that implements the transformer forward pass itself,
with no dependency on llama.cpp/ggml's compiled code and no Python. Every layer
speaks the OpenAI-compatible API. See *A complete stack* below.

**orangu** is named after the [Orangutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan) - the smartest ape.

## Features

* A complete Rust stack — the `orangu` editor, the `orangu-coordinator` model manager, and the native `orangu-server` GGUF inference engine, with no llama.cpp, ggml, or Python dependency
* OpenAI-compatible chat completions served by the built-in `orangu-server` — fully local, no Internet connection required after setup
* Interactive code review (`/review`) and LLM-driven auto review (`/auto_review`) of the changes on your branch, with a category-grouped report you can export or post to an issue
* Local file reading and editing
* Workspace-aware Git and forge tools (commit, rebase, push, pull requests, comments) for the whole change-and-review loop
* URL fetching for external knowledge
* Shell command execution inside the workspace
* Model switching and runtime server target control
* PDF export of the console or a review report (`/export`)
* Persistent history, shell-style editing, and a terminal status banner
* Built-in offline manual (`/manual`) with full-text search

## A complete stack

Most local-AI setups are a patchwork: one tool for the editor, a separate engine
for inference, and glue to manage which model is loaded. orangu is the whole
stack in one project — three cooperating programs, each speaking the
OpenAI-compatible API to the next:

![The orangu stack: orangu → orangu-coordinator → orangu-server](images/orangu-architecture.png)

* **`orangu`** — the workspace-aware coding environment you drive (this manual's
  main subject): the terminal UI, local and Git/forge tools, `/review` and
  `/auto_review`, the knowledge graph, semantic `/search`, and the
  context-compression engine.
* **`orangu-coordinator`** — an optional companion HTTP proxy that starts and
  stops `orangu-server` on demand and swaps to whichever model each request
  needs, so a single-GPU machine can use a different model per role without ever
  running more than one server at once. See the *Coordinator* chapter.
* **`orangu-server`** — *is* the inference engine: GGUF loading, tokenization,
  the transformer forward pass, sampling, and request scheduling implemented
  directly in Rust with no dependency on llama.cpp/ggml's compiled code, running
  on CPU or GPU (Vulkan, CUDA, ROCm, OpenCL). It also serves as the machine's
  GGUF inventory. See the *Inference server* chapter.

Because every layer talks to the next over the OpenAI-compatible API, the pieces
stay cleanly separated, yet they ship and run as one. The result is a fully
local, fully private, single-language AI coding stack — no Python, no llama.cpp,
no cloud.
